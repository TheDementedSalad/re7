# Instructions

Edit your splits and change the game name to "Resident Evil 7". A message should pop up saying an autosplitter by me is available. Click "Activate".

After activating the RE7 autosplitter, click "Settings". Place a checkmark next to every split you want to use.

Afterwards, create your splits. Name them anything you want (just make sure they correspond with a checkmarked autosplit). Order them however you'd like.

Make sure you compare against Game Time.

Any problems? Reach out to TheDementedSalad

# I have a split request?

Great, reach out to TheDementedSalad through the RE7 Speedrunning discord, and he'll see what he can do.

# Something didn't split or split at the wrong time.

Make sure you have the split checkmarked as explained above. If that doesn't work, or if a split of yours split at the wrong time, contact TheDementedSalad.

# Special thanks
